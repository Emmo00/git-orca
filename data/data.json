    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nThis issue aims to implement a new `InputField` component in the `mellow-react` template of the project. The `InputField` component is intended to provide a reusable input field with customizable options, such as different types (name, email, password) and different states (default, valid, invalid).\r\n\r\nParent Issue #17 \r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/sailscastshq/boring-stack/assets/25631971/9b0d3e39-4e1a-45ae-b8ea-677bf77aecfe)\r\n\r\n## Changes to be Made\r\n\r\n1. Create a new file component directory with filename within the `components` directory `InputField/input-field.js` to contain the implementation of the `InputField` component.\r\n2. Define the `InputField` component as a functional component using the `React` library.\r\n3. Create a `MellowIcon` directory within within the `components` directory to implement all associated icons in components (i.e `EnvelopeIcon`, `PortraitIcon`, `EyeIcon`, `LockIcon`), make this Icon components reusable with props such as `size`, `color` and additional props using the spread operator (`...props`).\r\n4. Define the prop types for the component, including `name`, `label`, `placeholder`, `type`, and `state` as required.\r\n5. Within the component, create a `ref` using the `useRef` hook to reference the input element.\r\n6. Implement the component's JSX structure, including a label, input field, icons, and error message display.\r\n7. Dynamically apply CSS classes to the input field based on the field's `state` (i.e. `default`, `valid`, `invalid`) prop using the `clsx` library.\r\n8. Handle different `type` props (name, email, password) to display the appropriate icons.\r\n9. Add event handling to the password `EyeIcon` component to toggle the visibility of the password text.\r\n10. Write the necessary CSS styles to achieve the desired visual appearance and behavior of the `InputField` component.\r\n\r\n## Criteria\r\n\r\n- The `InputField` component should render an input field with associated label, icons, and optional error message.\r\n- The component should accept various props, such as `name`, `label`, `placeholder`, `type`, and `state`, with appropriate prop type validations using `PropTypes`.\r\n- CSS classes and styles should be applied to the input field dynamically based on the provided `state` prop.\r\n- The component should handle the different `type` props to display the corresponding icons.\r\n- Event handling should be implemented for the password icon to toggle the visibility of the password text.\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n- Ensure that the `InputField` component is reusable, configurable, and can be easily integrated into different forms throughout the project.\r\n- Write unit tests (if possible) to validate the component's behavior, including prop type validations and event handling.\r\n"
